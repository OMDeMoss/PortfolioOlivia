# About me
Hi, my name is Olivia DeMoss and I am a art director and freelance graphic designer.

I have a very minimal, simplistic approach with the saying 'less is more' as a key influence on my style.

I am passionately creative, quality driven and motivated to create the best design solution, whether that be a simple logo, branding an entire company, producing cohesive & innovative packaging or publication design, I strive to provide excellence in everything I do.
